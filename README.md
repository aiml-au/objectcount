## Overview

The Object Count application empowers users to efficiently and accurately count objects in images by harnessing advanced deep learning techniques, such as class-agnostic counting and image segmentation. With the ability to work from just a few reference examples, it delivers rapid and reliable results across a wide range of use cases, including traffic analysis, retail inventory tracking, and industrial process monitoring. This repository serves as the issue tracker where users can:

- Report bugs and unexpected behavior
- Suggest new features
- Propose enhancements to the user interface, performance, or functionality

Please make sure to follow the provided templates and guidelines to help maintainers address the issues or requests efficiently.

### Example Feature Request
   
**Describe the bug**

When uploading a photo to the object count application, the app fails to return a result and instead displays an error message: "Image processing failed. Please try again later." This issue occurs consistently with images larger than 5MB.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to the object count application website.
2. Click on the "Upload Photo" button.
3. Select an image file larger than 5MB (e.g., a high-resolution JPEG).
4. Wait for the processing to complete.
5. See the error message instead of the object count result.

**Expected behavior**

The application should process the uploaded image regardless of its size (up to the maximum allowed limit) and return the correct object count.

**Screenshots**

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

- OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Google Chrome
- Version: 95.0.4638.69

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**

- Device: Samsung Galaxy S21
- OS: Android 11
- Browser: Chrome Mobile
- Version: 95.0.4638.74

**Additional context**

- The issue does not occur with images smaller than 5MB.
- There is no indication on the upload page about a file size limit.
- Compressing the image to below 5MB allows it to be processed successfully.
- Internet connection is stable, and other applications handle large file uploads without issue

### Example Feature Request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  

The object count application currently only supports single object types for counting (e.g., only counting one category such as cars, people, etc.). I often need to count multiple object types in a single image (e.g., both cars and people). This limitation means I have to manually count the second object type, which adds time to my workflow. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**  

I would like to see multi-class object detection added to the application, where the app can count multiple object types within a single image. For example, after uploading an image, the app should return the number of cars, people, and other relevant objects, all in one result.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  

One alternative is to upload the same image to different applications that specialize in counting specific object types, but this is time-consuming and inefficient. Another approach is to use general-purpose object detection models via an API, but they are often not as user-friendly as the object count application.

**Additional context**  

- This feature would be especially useful for users dealing with complex scenes, such as crowded environments or urban areas.
- A potential UI improvement could involve selecting which object categories to detect from a predefined list.
- Below is an example of an image where detecting both cars and people would be useful:

## Issue Guidelines

To ensure smooth and effective issue management:

- **Be clear and concise**: Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand the issue or request.
- **One issue per report**: Do not combine multiple bugs or feature requests into a single issue. This helps in organising and addressing each one separately.
- **Search before posting**: Check if your bug or feature request has already been submitted by someone else to avoid duplication.
